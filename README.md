# marvel-react

---
## Description

This is a project made with React with the Vite tool which shows a very simple web with the theme of Marvel Universe, which connects with the APIs of the project made in Ruby on Rails: [here](https://github.com/sabrinamcuevas/marvel-react).
The purpose is to consume the APIs and show the characters, comics, series and creators.

Any comments will be very welcome as I'm just starting in the world of React!
